## Welcome to modelevaluation.org!

**modelevaluation.org** is a web application for evaluating and benchmarking computational models. 

The main goal for `modelevaluation.org` is to **centralise, standardise and streamline** the workflow associated with model inter-comparisons. While this tool is often used in climate sciences with [land surface models](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/hydr/16/3/jhm-d-14-0158_1.xml), it is not restricted to this particular context. We welcome users from all fields to use `modelevaluation.org` for their own research questions and applications where comparing models is of interest.

### Getting started

We recommend checking out this [tutorial]() on how to get started with `modelevaluation.org`. We have also compiled some FAQs and other resources for further reading. 

### Want to contribute? 

`modelevaluation.org` is a community project â€“ [get in touch]() and help us make it better!
